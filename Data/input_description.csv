img_0,"a single continuous line forming a square spiral that starts from the center and winds outward in a clockwise direction, ending with a vertical line extending downward from the top-left corner.",Complex,Solved,
img_1,"an abstract geometric figure composed of several overlapping straight lines forming a complex, angular shape. At the center, the lines intersect to create a dense arrangement of triangles and sharp angles, giving the appearance of a distorted or irregular five-pointed star. The lines are black, uniform in thickness, and extend outward in different directions, with some reaching beyond the central form. The overall figure has a dynamic, unbalanced look, as if the lines were drawn freely without symmetry, resulting in a layered and tangled visual effect.",Complex,Unsolved,Can not be described!
